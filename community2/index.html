<h3>Claying with type</h3>	
	<h4>
A journey between the digital and the handmade. In the exhibition font designer Guðmundur Úlfarsson 
and product designer Hanna Dís Whitehead will showcase a collaborative project where they 
work with their joint interest in the journey between the digital and the handmade. 
The works they exhibit are based on a visual conversation between the two artists, 
from two-dimensional to three-dimensional and vice-versa, which is sometimes 
misunderstood and has even been distorted midway. Both Hanna and Guðmundur 
have a personal approach to their work, which is on the borders between design 
and art. In his font design, Guðmundur works with the language and textual art, 
while Hanna weaves materials, colours, forms and story together in her creation of 
sculptures, household objects, textiles, carpets and other products.

<h3>Anna – A prototype chair</h3>	

<h4>
	The anna chair was designed and handcrafted in 1986 by architect Anna Pála Pálsdóttir (b. 1953 IS) 
	as part of her final project at The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, School of Architecture in Copenhagen.

Architects Inga Rán Reynisdóttir (b. 1993), Pálsdóttir’s daughter, and Ulrike Marie Steen (b. 1978 in Denmark) 
have now organized a collection of unique sketches and original prototypes of the chair in order to create 
a respectful testimony of the design process and its legacy of expertise, inspiration and hard work.

During DesignMarch 2020, Reynisdóttir and Steen curate the launch of the anna chair.
 The aim of the exhibition is to demonstrate the significance of beautiful design and 
 traditional craftsmanship. The material for the exhibition is carefully selected, 
 captioned and set within a larger context and narrative by displaying contemporary
  textile, stone and wood works, thus offering a fuller experience of the collected items.

The exhibition is a tribute to Nordic design, manifested in this elegant and timeless piece of furniture.

<h3>Appetite for Change</h3>	

<h4>
	Skyr, salted cod, spices, meat, ice cream and honey were among the themes that students in the ceramics department at 
	RSVA focused on in their research and concept development in designing and producing pieces 
	from porcelain where the focus point was food and sustainability.

We live in a time where we have to think about consumption and what we produce in a 
global context. How can we develop new ideas that enhance our understanding of the 
situation? Ideas that reduce food waste and increase consumers’ respect for ingredients, 
ideas that make it easier for us to use and preserve ingredients and deepen the experience 
of consuming food. In light of this, the students in the ceramics department at Reykjavík 
School of Visual Arts developed pieces casted in porcelain that are shown at the 
exhibition along with the working process.

<h3>ARKITYPA upcycled design</h3>	

<h4>
	Innovative architecture and reused materials from the construction industry merge in the creations of ARKITÝPA.
The exhibition will showcase ARKITÝPUR, which are designed objects based on 
architectural drawings and form finding conceptual work, with reuse of building materials in focus.

Innovative architecture and reused materials from the construction industry merge in the creations of ARKITÝPA.
ARKITÝPA is a collaboration of two architects, Ástríður Birna Árnadóttir FAÍ and Karitas Möller FAÍ.
ARKITÝPUR are designed objects with the aim of increasing the interaction between 
their experience and the use of the space in which they are located. These can be 
building elements or furniture that create a new vision, quality and experience in 
the space. The design expresses a play in scale, shapes, colors, materials and combinations.

<h3>Circle</h3>	

<h4>
	“Circle” is a collection of new homeware by Reykjavík Trading Co. in collaboration with a selection of restaurants & Þóra Breiðfjörð within their community of Hafnarfjörður. The couple gathers, designs & creates new pieces utilizing food waste & bring it back to the home in another form of life.

The couple behind Reykjavík Trading Co. (R.T.Co.) will exhibit “Circle” for Design March 2020 where their focus pertains to food waste & on concentrating on the immediate community where you dwell.

The theme is simple. Taking food waste & other organic materials within a circular radius of their home / 
studio from restaurants & cafes to create new dinnerware / homeware & bringing the once discarded 
items back to the table in another form, now in the shape of stoneware or soft goods. Ceramic 
pieces are in collaboration with Þóra Breiðfjörð, an Icelandic ceramic artist.

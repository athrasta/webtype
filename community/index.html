			"The ideal woman has always been generic. 
			I bet you can picture the version of her that runs the show today. 
			She’s of indeterminate age but resolutely youthful presentation. 
			She’s got glossy hair and the clean, shameless expression of a person who 
			believes she was made to be looked at. She is often luxuriating when you see 
			her—on remote beaches, under stars in the desert, across a carefully styled table,
			surrounded by beautiful possessions or photogenic friends. Showcasing herself at 
			leisure is either the bulk of her work or an essential part of it; in this, she is not 
			so unusual—for many people today, especially for women, packaging and broadcasting your
			image is a readily monetizable skill. She has a personal brand, and probably a boyfriend
			or husband: he is the physical realization of her constant, unseen audience, reaffirming 
			her status as an interesting subject, a worthy object, a self-generating spectacle with a viewership attached."</div>

			"“The usual I we are given has all the tidy containment of the kind of character the realist novel 
			specializes in and none of the porousness of our every waking moment...the loose threads, the strange dreams, 
			the forgettings and misrememberings, the portions of a life lived through others’ stories, the incoherence 
			and inconsistency, the pantheon of dei ex machina and the companionability of ghosts. There are other ways of telling.”"</div>
